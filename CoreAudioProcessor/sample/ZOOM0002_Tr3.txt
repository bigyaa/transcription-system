[30.555 - 56.374]   Robert Frost said that home is where when you go there they have to take you in. I amend that and say home is when when you go there they want to take you in. Welcome home!
[57.654 - 81.237]   I am Corine Stavich and it is my privilege to be here tonight to welcome you on behalf of the International Storytelling Center, your hosts for this weekend and you know this is the kick off event and we are back at the library tent.
[81.749 - 103.507]   middle of Jonesboro, Tennessee. This is our homecoming and what a home. It's so nostalgic being here in Jonesboro, Tennessee. You know, it's sort of Tennessee's Lake Wobegon where all the children are above average.
[104.65 - 112.688]   All the adults are above average, and certainly all the storytellers are above average.
[118.404 - 148.336]   Where else could a storytelling festival have been nurtured and grown, but a place that's filled with kindness and love and integrity? And so you're going to see a lot of Jonesboro volunteers this weekend, hundreds of them, thank them because they've been taking care of us for 49 years. So OK.
[149.326 - 156.118]   And while we're saying thank you, let's please thank the Bank of Tennessee for sponsoring this event tonight.
